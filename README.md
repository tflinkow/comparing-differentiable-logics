## Reproducing the results from the paper

The experiments were run on `Python 3.11.11`.
The provided `requirements.txt` can be used to install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Training experiment
The training experiments from the paper can be run using `cd training && sh run.sh`.

Assuming you have a reasonably up-to-date LaTeX distribution installed, the plots and tables from the publication can then be generated with `cd reports && make`.

### Verification experiment
The verification experiment from the paper can be run using `cd verification && bash run.sh`.

Note that this requires the `.onnx` network files, which will by default be in `results/strong-classification-robustness/mnist/` after running the training experiment.

Also note that for improved solver performance, we use [Marabou built from source with Gurobi support](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou?tab=readme-ov-file#compile-marabou-with-the-gurobi-optimizer-optional).

A standard installation of Marabou can be installed with `pip install maraboupy==2.0.0` and can be used for the verification experiment without any changes to the verification files, however, verification will take longer and will most likely require increased timeouts.
